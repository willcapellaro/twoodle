			<p>The Willingness-Want-y-ness matrix is a market segmentation framework developed by Nathan Fraser and first published in <a href="">Start-Up Cheat Codes: Success Shortcuts for Your Start-Up or Small Business</a>, which is generally available as a free eBook. The recipe and context is published here with Nathan's permission.</p>
			<h3>Why it works</h3>
			<p>The Willingness-Want-y-ness recipe can be used to organize one of two sets, 1) target market audiences or users, or 2) individual products, or features or market positions.</p>
			<p class="funBox"><strong>Still baking this recipe!</strong> The Twoodle engine is being tuned to better serve this recipe. Known challenges: larger lists; mixing target markets and products; alternative ways or setting priority levels besides ordered lists.</p>

<p>
This page should give you all you need to use the recipe, and includes the full text from the associated chapter. However, it's highly recommended to read the rest of <a href="">Start-Up Cheat Codes</a>.</p>
<h3>When it doesn't work</h3>
<p>Don't confuse this recipe with ones for work priorization. This is all about people in the market, and how they respond to a product's positioning. It can be tempting to use this for work priorization. There is a lot of correlation, but there are some key distinctions. Consider using Impact/Ease alone or both recipes as separate exercises.</p>

 <!-- <p class="funBox"><strong>Avoid imitation recipes!</strong> Urgency-Importance sounds similar but it is the devil's work.</p> -->

			<h3>Choosing the Best Target Market</h3>
			<p>Now that you have a good idea of what you want to sell, next, comes the question of who to sell it to?</p>
			<p>The obvious (in incorrect) answer is, "whoever's willing to buy it."</p>
			<p>No matter what you sell, there will be different markets looking to buy it. But if you try and sell to all of them at once, you'll end up appealing to none of them. That's why it makes sense to pick one section of the market and focus on them, exclusively.</p>
			<p>Think of it like this;</p>
			<p>Let's say you're a restaurant owner, and you sell mainkly beef-based meals. But not all beef is created equal.</p>
			<p>Someone who's looking for prime rib isn't gonna want a Big Mac.</p>
			<p>Someone who's looking for a Big Mac isn't gonna want to spend the extra money on a prime rib dinner.</p>
			<p>Standing out on a corner with a sign that says "Beef-based meals" won't appear to either.</p>
			<p>You have to pick one and drive the other one away. Trying to appear to both will only drive both of them away.</p>
			<p>Let's explore.</p>
			<p>Every market can be broken up into four main quadrants. Three of these quadrants can be profitable. One of them always spells certain doom. But, to target any one quadrant, you must disregard the other three.</p>
			<p>These four quadrants fall on an X- and Y- axis.</p>
			<p>I call it the Willingness/Want-y-ness Quadrant.</p>
			<p><h5>The X-Axis; Want-y-ness</h5></p>
			<p>[image of matrix]</p>
			<p>This axis measures how many people want what you are selling. The furthere to the left, the more niched down you offering becomes. The further to the right, the more mass-market your offer becomes.</p>
			<p>Taking it back to the beef example; Big Macs would be a mass-market product, while grass-fed, organic rib-eye woul dbe a niche market. Netierh market is superior to the other, at face value.</p>
			<p>On one hand, if you want to make a million dollars, you can sell a one-dollar product to a million people. Having a mass-market offer makes that possible.</p>
			<p>One the other hand, having a mass-market offer probably means you'll have a lot of competition. The Big Mac has to compete with the Whopper, the Five-Dollar Carl's Jr. Burger, and more. But competition isn't a bad thing.</p>
			<p>If a lot of people are selling something, it's because a lot of people are buying.</p>
			<p>The reason you might want to niche down is to carve out a little section of that mass marekt and claim it as your own. Take the shark-infested red ocean, and find a little blue oceqn inside of it to call your home. To do that, you have to niche down.</p>
			<p>This means serving a smaller percentage of the market and moving to the left on the X-axis.</p>
			<p>The way you do this is by coming up with your own USP (Unique Selling Proposition). This is something that sets you apart from all the competition out there, giving people a reason to buy from you, instead. But you can't just be different for the sake of being different.</p>
			<p>You must have a desireable difference.</p>
			<p>My favorite example of this would be an orange tennis ball.</p>
			<p>The mass-market buys green tennis balls, and that's fine for people playing tennis with them.</p>
			<p>But some people buy them to play fetch with their dog, and the green tennis balls keep getting lost in the the grass. Therefore; orange tennis balls.</p>
			<p>It's a smaller part of the tennis-ball-buying market who wants your product. But yours is the only product they will buy.</p>
			<p>In this case, the riches are in niches.</p>
			<h5>The Y-Axis; Willingness (To Spend)</h5></p>
			<p>Next is the Y-axis.</p>
			<p>[image of matrix]</p>
			<p>This axis measures how much the people in your market are willing to spend on a product or service such as yours.</p>
			<p>People at the bottom are not willing to spend very much. People at the top don't see money as that much of an issue.</p>
			<p>Again, this affects the size of your slice of the market as well.</p>
			<p>Taking it back to the beef example; almost anyone can spend five bucks on a Big Mac. Not nearly as many people can spend 50 bucks on a grass-fed cut of rib-eye, served with fine wine in a fancy restaurant.</p>
			<p>Do you want to sell a million meals for a dollar each, or one thousand meals for $1,000 each?</p>
			<p>Both are possible, but the $1,000-a-plate people won't give you a second chance if they see you as a dollar burger salesman. And the much larger group of people looking for a one-dollar hamburger will be too afraid to ask if they assume you'll charge them a thousand dollars.</p>
			<p>Almost any section of the market you choose to serve will make you money... if you know how to sell to them. Except for the bottom left quadrant.</p>
			<p>The bottom left is a niche market with no money to spend. That means, only a tiny amount of people want what you're selling, but none of them have any money to spend on it.</p>
			<p><strong>This quadrant is certain death for a business owner.</strong></p>
			<p>If you want to serve this quadrant, start a charity, not a business.</p>
			<p>To further explain, let's look at this example with wristwatches, shall we?</p>
			<p>[matrix image]</p>
			<p>In the bottom-left (D), you'd ahve something crazy like a sundial watch.</p>
			<p>Not many people would want it. And the few people who would, probably wouldn't be willing to spend that much money on one.</p>
			<p><strong>Bad business idea.</strong></p>
			<p>Can you make it work? Yeah.</p>
			<p>Will it be worth the effort? I doubt it.</p>
			<p>In the bottom-right (C), you've got your cheap digital Casio watches.</p>
			<p>The people buying them will only spend 20 bucks on one, but there are millions of people willing to spend that 20 bucks. It means extra work to keep up with demand, but with a decen profit margin, this is a sustainable market to go after.</p>
			<p>The top-right (B) would be people looking to buy Apple and other Smart Watches.</p>
			<p>Not quite as many people as the market for 20-dollar Casios, but still a pretty massive market. Your watches might be a little more expensive to produce, but your market will pay the extra money for a better watch. This is a sustainable market to go after.</p>
			<p>Finally, we have the top-left quadrant (A).</p>
			<p>These would be your high-end wristwatches like Rolex and Chopard. These are luxury timepieces. The market buying them isn't interested so much in their ability to keep time, but in their ability to pronounce status.</p>
			<p>You won't sell nearly as many of these watches in a year. But the ones you do sell will net you a rather large profit.</p>
			<p>This, too, is a very sustainable market to go after, if you know how to sell to them.</p>
			<h5>Picking your market is half the battle.</h5>
			<p>Avoid the bottom-left quadrant (D) at all costs. Any other segment of the market is sustainable.</p>
			<p>But remember, each quadrant likes to be sold to in a different way. Pick one and stick to them. Learn what works for them and master it.</p>
			<p>Once you've mastered your first market segment, you can expand to others. But if you try to nail down the messaging for more than one market at a time, you'll just confuse yourself and the people you're trying to sell to.</p>
			<p>I prefer to sell to the top-left quadrant (A), but I've made a lot of money on the right-hand side of the X-axis (B and C) as well. In fact, the right-hand side offers the most ability to scale your business up, so don't write them off without careful consideration.</p>
			<p>Now you have a good idea of what to sell, and which market to sell it to. Next, we'll discover how to make the most money in any market, right off the bat, with almost no effort at all.</p>

			<h3>Recipe in Practice</h3>
			<!-- <h4 class="note">Interact with some content to learn this recipe</h4>  -->
			<p>To start, add your items. Pick one of two types of content: 1) target market audiences or users, or 2) individual products, or features or market positions. </p>

			<p>Or see example content<button class="btn-link linkBtn">Beef example</button> <button class="btn-link linkBtn">Wristwatch example</button></p>
			<div class="paperStock tornBottom ">
				<div class="paperMargin">
					<div id="itemsList" onchange="verifyItemsNames();" class="itemsListSortableStop"></div>
					<button id="addButton" class="primaryBtn" onclick="addItem();">+ Add an item</button>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br><br>
<h3>Prioritization</h3>
			<p>Now that you have your items, sort the items you have based on Importance. Use drag and drop to sort your items. The top item should be the most important. Ignore timing for this exercise, think only of the value delivered by completing each task.</p>


<div class="paperStock tornBottom tornTop">
	<div class="paperMargin ">
		<div id="rateYDiv" class="activeTab">
			
			<div class="inlineDiv">
				<label class="tabHeading"><p id="recipeTitleRateYDiv" class="labelFloatRight"></p><i class="fa fa-caret-right iSpace"></i>Prioritization<i class="fa fa-caret-right iSpace"></i>Importance</label>
			</div>
			<label id="lblChangeY" class="labelFloatRight"></label>
			<div id="yItemsList" class="valuesListSortableStop"></div>
		</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		<br><br>
		
		<p>Now add the timing factor by sorting the items one more time. Only think of the clock and calendar here; Importance isn't important. Think only of when each task is best completed. The first item should be utmost, last one chillaxed. </p>

<div class="paperStock tornBottom tornTop">

			<label id="lblChangeX" class="labelFloatRight"></label>
			<div id="xItemsList" class="valuesListSortableStop"></div>
		</div>
</div>
	</div>
</div>
<br><br>
		<h3>Twoodle Results</h3>
			<p>Finally you can reap the benefits of your work. Because you're doing an Importance-Urgency twoodle, highest priority items are in the top right quad. Top left and bottom right are also of value. It's recommended to avoid those in the bottom left.</p>

			<h4>Twoodle Results List</h4>
<p>Matrixes are great and all, but who doesn't like a to do list? Use this to work down the items in logical order. The top three all lead to success, and we recommend trying to stay in one mode at a time. The Avoid section is to be avoided, so we automatically collapse that. But take a look at the time and effort you're saving..</p>
